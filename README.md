## Projects

1. **Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning**
    - **Description:** Developed and evaluated multiple baseline machine learning models to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign.
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression, SVM (RBF), Random Forest, KNN
    - **Results:** Baseline models achieved near-perfect ROC–AUC (~0.995) and ~97–98% accuracy without hyperparameter tuning.

2. **Decision Tree Classifier on Iris Dataset**
    - **Description:** Built an interpretable Decision Tree classification model to predict Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Decision Tree Classifier
    - **Results:** Achieved 95.56% test accuracy, with perfect classification of Iris Setosa and minor confusion between Versicolor and Virginica.

3. **Decision Tree Classifier on Car Evaluation**
    - **Description:** Developed a Decision Tree classification model to evaluate car acceptability (unacc, acc, good, vgood) based on categorical attributes such as safety, price, maintenance cost, and passenger capacity.
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Graphviz, Decision Tree Classifier
    - **Results:** After applying ordinal encoding, class weighting, and cost-complexity pruning, the tuned Decision Tree achieved ~99.5% test accuracy with improved generalization and reduced overfitting.

4. **Random Forest Classifier on the Palmer Penguins Dataset**
    - **Description:** Built a robust multiclass classification model using Random Forest to predict penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) based on morphological measurements and location.
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Random Forest Classifier, ColumnTransformer, Pipeline
    - **Results:** Achieved 97.7% test accuracy with strong and balanced F1-scores across all three species.

5. **Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction (Random Forest Regression)**
    - **Description:** Built a regression model to predict concrete compressive strength (MPa) using mix composition and curing age.
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor (OOB Validation)
    - **Results:** A baseline Linear Regression achieved a test R² of 0.63, while the final Random Forest model improved performance to 0.87 test R² with ~40% error reduction (RMSE: 9.8 → 5.83 MPa, MAE: 7.75 → 4.25 MPa).

6. **Telco Customer Churn Prediction (Random Forest Classification)**
   - **Description:** Developed a customer churn prediction system using a Random Forest classifier to identify customers at risk of churn in a subscription-based telecom business.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Random Forest Classifier, Target Encoding, OOB Validation
   - **Results:** The final Random Forest model achieved an OOB score of ~0.76, ROC-AUC of ~0.84, and accuracy of ~0.78, demonstrating strong ranking performance and generalization.

7. **Linear Regression on Advertising Dataset**
    - **Description:** Applied Simple and Multiple Linear Regression to analyze how TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising spending influences product sales, focusing on a correct, assumption-driven regression workflow and model interpretability.
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, Statsmodels
    - **Results:** TV advertising alone explained ~67% of sales variance (R² ≈ 0.68), while the Multiple Linear Regression model improved performance to R² ≈ 0.91, significantly reducing prediction error. TV and Radio emerged as strong predictors, whereas Newspaper showed minimal impact.
    - **Project Link:** [View Repository](https://github.com/PranayDomal/Advertising_Sales_Prediction)
  
7. **Mall Customers Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**
    - **Description:** Applied K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on annual income and spending behavior, to identify clear, behavior-driven customer groups using Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, K-Means Clustering, StandardScaler
    - **Results:** Identified 5 well-separated customer segments with a peak Silhouette Score of ~0.55, capturing distinct spending patterns such as high-value customers, careful high-income customers, and impulsive low-income spenders. The clusters are interpretable and suitable for targeted marketing strategies.
