## Projects

1. **Decision Tree Classifier on Iris Dataset**
  - **Description:** Built an interpretable Decision Tree classification model to predict Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using sepal and petal measurements. The project emphasizes model transparency and rule-based decision making on a clean, balanced dataset.
  - **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Decision Tree Classifier
  - **Results:** Achieved 95.56% test accuracy, with perfect classification of Iris Setosa and minor confusion between Versicolor and Virginica. The model learned clear, biologically meaningful rules, identifying petal length and petal width as the most important features.
